<h1>MiikeMineStamps</h1>

<p>
  This is an official webpage of MiikeMineStamps dataset.
</p>

<p>
  The MiikeMineStamps dataset is a naturally long-tailed open-ended dataset in the domain of Japanese historical documents. 
  It contains 5056 images of Japanese stamps that belong to 407 classes including two special ones. 
  The stamps were extracted from a large compendium of historical documents from the Japanese company Mitsui Miâ€™ike Mine, 
  one of the largest business archives in modern Japan that spans half a century, includes tens of thousands of documents,
  and has been widely used by labor historians, business historians, and others.

<h3>Info</h3>
 
<p>
  The current version is v1.0. 
</p>

<p>
  The collection currently has 5056 images of 415 stamps collected from hundreds of documents. 
  New versions will be published as our expert labels more images.
</p>

<p>
  Figure 1 shows several examples of stamps.

  The histogram of number of samples per stamp name is shown below. 
  The dataset is collected via active learning, colors signify the cycle.

<h3>Dataset structure</h3>
  
<p>
  The dataset consists of 5056 cropped images of stamps (Figure 1) and the related meta-information. 
  Meta-information is available in two formats: json and SQLite database with Shuffler schema.
  Json is human-readable and easier to load with conventional tools, 
  Shuffler database format is easier to get various statistics.
</p>
  
<p>
  The following information is available for each image:
  <ul>
    <li><code>imagefile</code>: the path to the image.</li>
    <li><code>name</code>: stamp class name, see the conventions below.</li>
    <li><code>decade</code>: the decade of the document where the stamp was originally placed.</li>
    <li><code>x_on_page</code>: x coordinate of the stamp center relative to the enclosing page (in range [0, 1]).</li>
    <li><code>y_on_page</code>: y coordinate of the stamp center relative to the enclosing page (in range [0, 1]).</li>
    <li><code>width_on_page</code>: width of the stamp relative to the enclosing page (in range [0, 1]).</li>
    <li><code>height_on_page</code>: height of the stamp relative to the enclosing page (in range [0, 1]).</li>
  </ul>
</p>
  
<p>
  The last four fields are recorded when pages can be identified in a photograph and the stamp is located inside one of the pages. 
  Some stamp classes are consistently located in one of the corners of their pages.
</p>
  
<h3>Conventions for stamp names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stamp names are lowercase letters, underscores, and two special characters: "+" and "?".
    Stamp names are English phonetical spelling of the Japanese names.</li>
  <li>Most names contain only letters, e.g. "kuru".</li>
  <li>"+" in a name means that only one half of a stamp is visible, because two conforming documents were stamped together. 
    Only the top of a stamp is visible if "+" is after the stamp name (e.g. 'kei+'), 
    and only the bottom of a stamp is visible if "+" before the stamp name (e.g. '+kei').</li>
  <li>"?" in a name (e.g."oomuta?unhontenin") means that one symbol in a stamp was not recognized.</li>
  <li>Name "??" is a special name that means that a stamp was not recognized.</li>
  <li>Name "+??" is a special name that means that a stamp was not recognized and only its bottom is visible.</li>
  <li>Name "stamphere" is a special name, and is a literal translation of the text in the stamp.</li>
</ul>
