                This is an official webpage of MiikeMineStamps dataset.
            </p>

            <p>
                The MiikeMineStamps dataset is a naturally long-tailed open-ended dataset in the domain of Japanese
                historical documents.
                It contains 5056 images of Japanese stamps that belong to 415 classes including two special ones.
                The stamps were extracted from a large compendium of historical documents from the Japanese company
                Mitsui Mi’ike Mine, one of the largest business archives in modern Japan that spans half a century,
                includes tens of thousands of documents, and has been widely used by labor historians, business
                historians, and others.

            <h3>Dataset structure</h3>

            <p>
                The dataset consists of 5056 cropped images of stamps (Figure 1) and the related meta-information.
                Meta-information is available in two formats: json and SQLite database with <a
                    href="https://github.com/kukuruza/shuffler">Shuffler</a> schema.
                Json is human-readable and easier to load with conventional tools,
                Shuffler database format is easier to get various statistics.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following information is available for each image:
            <ul>
                <li><code>imagefile</code>: the path to the image.</li>
                <li><code>name</code>: stamp class name, see the conventions below.</li>
                <li><code>decade</code>: the decade of the document where the stamp was originally placed.</li>
                <li><code>x_on_page</code>: x coordinate of the stamp center relative to the enclosing page (in range
                    [0,
                    1]).
                </li>
                <li><code>y_on_page</code>: y coordinate of the stamp center relative to the enclosing page (in range
                    [0,
                    1]).
                </li>
                <li><code>width_on_page</code>: width of the stamp relative to the enclosing page (in range [0, 1]).
                </li>
                <li><code>height_on_page</code>: height of the stamp relative to the enclosing page (in range [0, 1]).
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The last four fields are recorded when pages can be identified in a photograph and the stamp is located
                inside one of the pages.
                Some stamp classes are consistently located in one of the corners of their pages.
            </p>

            <h3>Stamp names conventions</h3>

            <p>
                Stamp names are usually based on the phonetic reading of the Japanese characters using a modified
                Hepburn
                system.
                There are several exceptions to this, however. First, stamps that ask different catefories of users such
                as
                branch head, secretary, etc. to certify a document by placing their stamp in a particular place are
                collectively labeled "stamphere." Second,
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Stamp names are lowercase letters, underscores, and two special characters: "+" and "?".
                    Stamp names are usually based on the phonetic reading of the Japanese characters using a modified
                    Hepburn system.
                </li>
                <li>Most names contain only letters, e.g. "kuru".</li>
                <li>"+" in a name means that only one half of a stamp is visible, because two conforming documents were
                    stamped together.
                    Only the top of a stamp is visible if "+" is after the stamp name (e.g. 'kei+'),
                    and only the bottom of a stamp is visible if "+" before the stamp name (e.g. '+kei').
                </li>
                <li>There are pairs of identical stamp names, one of which ends with the suffix "_east", e.g. "itou" and
                    "itou_east".
                    These are the names of two different individuals who have the same phonetic reading in English,
                    such as 伊藤 and 伊東, both of which are read as itou.
                    They are referred to as "itou" and "itou_east" in reference to the second Chinese character of the
                    name.
                </li>
                <li>"?" in a name (e.g."oomuta?unhontenin") means that one symbol in a stamp was not recognized.</li>
                <li>Name "??" is a special name that means that a stamp was not recognized.</li>
                <li>Name "+??" is a special name that means that a stamp was not recognized and only its bottom is
                    visible.
                </li>
                <li>Name "stamphere" is a special name. Stamps that ask different catefories of users such as branch
                    head,
                    secretary, etc.
                    to certify a document by placing their stamp in a particular place are collectively labeled
                    "stamphere."
                </li>
            </ul>
